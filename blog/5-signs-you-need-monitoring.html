                        You don't need to wait for a disaster to set up monitoring. If you saw yourself in any of these 5 signs, you're already at risk.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The good news? Setting up monitoring takes 5 minutes. The free plan is genuinely useful. And catching one outage pays for years of monitoring.

                        Don't be like me. Don't wait until you lose $400 and look unprofessional in front of customers. Set it up now, while everything is working, so you're ready when something inevitably breaks.
